# Power 4

This project is the game of Power 4. 

I did it in 2018, during my 2nd year of university license. This is a personnel project, and is developed in Python3.

## Rules
To win a game of power 4, you just have to be the first to align 4 chips of its color horizontally, vertically and diagonally.

## To begin
Do the command :  `$ git clone https://github.com/debroucker/Puissance_4` to recover this repository.

## Prerequisite
You need to have Python3.
So, if you haven't it, do the command : `$ sudo apt-get install python3`

## Start-up
To lunch the game, do the command : `$ python3 puissance_4_turtle.py`, and enjoy.
